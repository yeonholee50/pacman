This project was created during summer camp as many of the students were bored. Some of them wanted to learn programming, so I created this project to show a step by step process in how to create a game. Minecraft took a long time, so many chose Pacman over Flappybird. In turn, they created their own games after seeing the demonstration. The original png images are not in this repo but can simply be put into executing directory from images
